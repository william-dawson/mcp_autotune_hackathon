# MCP Hackathon Tuner

For the MCP hackathon, we pick a simple example having an LLM optimize some
code for computing Lennard-Jones interactions. The code is written in C,
with an associated makefile. We can start with things like having the compiler
tweak the flags for gcc. Then we can ask it to consider some actual hand
written optimizations.
